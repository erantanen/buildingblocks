## Building Blocks

These are very rough building blocks for python ideas that are in progress of being created/evolving.




Each block has a bit of write-up inside of it (maybe) but should be easy to identify purpose.

need to build some lists of the blocks, 


1. ascii-txt_spinner.py

   blah blah blah


2. dict_build_from_file.py

Enjoy.
